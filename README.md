# Local replica of Rey Fluid demo

This folder contains a static HTML/CSS/JS replica of the Rey Fluid Squarespace demo.

- `index.html` — main page
- `css/styles.css` — site styles
- `js/script.js` — tiny enhancement (smooth scroll)
- `img/` — put your images here (I referenced `img/lilac-frame-mobile.png` already)

How to run

Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use a local web server). The fonts are left as default; replace images in `img/` as needed.
